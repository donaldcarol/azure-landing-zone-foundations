# Security Baseline



## 1. Overview



This document defines the security baseline for a cloud-first architecture using Microsoft Entra ID, Intune and Microsoft 365, combined with selected on-premises services.



The goal is to implement a strong, practical security posture suitable for a 50–250 user organization without excessive complexity.



---



## 2. Security Principles



- Identity is the primary security boundary

- Assume breach mindset (Zero Trust principles)

- Least privilege access

- Device trust and compliance

- Network segmentation

- Minimize attack surface

- Monitor and respond



---



## 3. Identity Security



### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Required for all users

- Enforced via Conditional Access

- Prefer authenticator apps over SMS



### Conditional Access Policies



Minimum recommended policies:



1\. Require MFA for all users

2\. Block legacy authentication

3\. Require compliant device for sensitive apps

4\. Apply stricter controls for admins

5\. Optional: restrict access by location



---



## 4. Privileged Access



- Separate admin accounts from user accounts

- No daily use of privileged accounts

- Limit number of global admins

- Use role-based access control (RBAC)

- Consider Just-In-Time access (PIM) where available



---



## 5. Device Security (Intune)



### Compliance Policies

Devices must meet:



- BitLocker enabled

- Firewall enabled

- Antivirus enabled

- OS version compliant

- No jailbreak/root



### Configuration Profiles

- Disable insecure settings

- Enforce password/PIN policies

- Configure screen lock timeout

- Restrict removable media (optional)



---



## 6. Endpoint Protection



- Microsoft Defender enabled

- Real-time protection active

- Cloud protection enabled

- Regular updates

- Attack surface reduction rules (if applicable)



---



## 7. Data Protection



### Cloud Data

- OneDrive and SharePoint with versioning

- Access controlled via Entra groups

- Sharing restrictions configured



### Local Data

- Stored on file server or NAS

- Access controlled via permissions

- Regular backups



---



## 8. Network Security



- VLAN segmentation (users, servers, printers, guest)

 Firewall rules:

&#x20; - allow only required traffic

&#x20; - block unnecessary lateral movement

- Guest network isolated

- Printers and IoT isolated



---



## 9. Application Security



- Prefer modern authentication (OAuth, SAML)

- Avoid legacy protocols

- Limit access to business applications

- Monitor usage and access



---



## 10. Logging and Monitoring



Minimum monitoring includes:



- Sign-in logs (Entra ID)

- Audit logs

- Endpoint alerts

- Firewall logs



Optional enhancements:

- Centralized logging

- SIEM integration (e.g., Microsoft Sentinel)



\---



## 11. Backup and Recovery



- Regular backups for:

&#x20; - file server

&#x20; - application server

- Test restore procedures

- Optional cloud backup



---



## 12. Remote Access Security



- Secure VPN (to office, if used)

- MFA required

- Restricted access

- Logging enabled



---



## 13. Security Risks



Common risks:



- weak passwords or MFA bypass

- unmanaged devices

- legacy authentication

- flat networks

- overprivileged users



---



## 14. Summary



This baseline provides:



- strong identity protection

- secure device posture

- controlled network access

- practical and scalable security



It is designed to balance security and usability for small and medium-sized organizations.
